## How to use the code
There is no particular way to use the code. The code should be ran and it will automatically pull a list of all champions that will then be used to access each individual champion JSON file where the JSON file will have specific data pulled that is most useful to the user when determining what champion to pick for themselves. 

### How the code was made
Essentially, all the code was created using ChatGPT in an iterative process in order to pull all the correct data as I had intended. There will be two shared links for the ChatGPT assistance, the first was used to formulate the code that would be pulling from the Riot Games API and the second was primarily used for help in building the flask app that would be later used in the website on Github Webpages.
